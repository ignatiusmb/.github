# contributing

thanks for your interest in contributing! this is a personal github account, and most projects here are experiments or personal tools i've decided to share. each repo may have its own contributing guidelines, but if not, this document serves as the default.

## ways to contribute

* **report issues** – open an issue if you've found a bug or want to suggest an idea.
* **send pull requests** – if you see a fix or improvement, feel free to open a PR.
* **discussions** – if enabled, use those for open-ended topics or questions about the project.

## standards

* keep discussions respectful and constructive (see the **code of conduct**).
* explain the motivation behind changes, not just the code.
* aim for small, focused changes — they're easier to review and merge.

## workflow

1. fork the repo and create a branch for your change.
2. make your edits, following any conventions that exist in that repo.
3. open a pull request with a clear description of the change.
4. wait for review; changes may be requested before merging.

## notes

* project-specific contributing guides (if present) override this global file. check the repo first.
* some projects may be dormant or archived, so contributions there might not receive a response.

thanks again for taking the time to contribute.
